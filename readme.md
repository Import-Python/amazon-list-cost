# Amazon List Cost Calculator
This is Chromium based extension with the purpose to
  - Add up all products in a list
  - It will also multiply if you have a quantity of a product
  
## Installation

Download and extract the [master.zip](https://github.com/Import-Python/amazon-list-cost-extension/archive/master.zip). And if you need help look below.

For [Chrome] users! (or less educated people...)
 1. Click the three little dots or lines in the top right corner
 2. Go to settings (near bottom of drop down)
 3. Click Extensions (left of page, within a sidebar)
 4. Click the check box named __Developer mode__ on the top right of this page
 5. Click the button named __Load unpacked extension__
 6. Find the folder you exracted to (usually in Downloads or Desktop)



And as for [Vivaldi] users or other browser of some type...
 1. Press __CTRL__ and __E__ for extensions and enable developer mode and install like mentioned above.

## Usage
Go to amazon.com (other sites and languages may be supported later) and find a list.   
It will popup a little gray box (not closeable) in the bottom left hand corner.   
Also it will put the amount next to the list title (near top of list). 

If you delete an product of the list it will update almost instantly (3 second delay at most)

##  About
I made this to see how to make a Chromium based extension, which I think turned out okay?    
Also adding everything I want into a list and too see about how much it cost was nice.
